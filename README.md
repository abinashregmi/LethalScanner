# LethalScanner
#### ABSTRACT
In today’s digital world, web security is very important because many web applications unintentionally expose sensitive directories and configuration files. These "hidden" paths can lead to a critical security vulnerability known as Information Disclosure, where unauthorized users gain access to private data like server credentials and databases. To address this, I am developing LethalScanner, which utilizes Python libraries such as Requests and SQLite. The Requests library helps send many requests at a time using a dictionary-based wordlist. SQLite fulfills the database requirement, which is necessary for the project’s data persistence and reporting. The scanner identifies vulnerabilities by analyzing HTTP status codes. For instance, a "200 OK" response confirms a discovered directory, while a "403 Forbidden" response indicates protected but existing paths. These findings are automatically stored in an SQLite database, creating a structured report of the web architecture. In conclusion, LethalScanner provides an efficient way to automate web reconnaissance, replacing slow manual searches with high-speed Python automation. By using this tool, developers can find vulnerabilities before they are exposed and prevent them from being exploited by malicious actors.
